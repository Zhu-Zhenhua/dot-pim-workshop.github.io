Workshop on Agile Design and Optimization Tools for Processing-In-Memory (DOT-PIM)

Overview
In the era of artificial intelligence and big data, the von Neumann architecture with separated memory and computing is facing a serious "memory wall" problem. The data movements have become the main bottleneck limiting the performance and energy efficiency of hardware platforms. The emerging Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures provide an effective solution to overcome the memory wall problem. PIM architectures perform the in-situ matrix-vector multiplications in memory or general-purpose computing near memory, eliminating data movements between memory and computing units. Due to their high energy efficiency, PIM architectures are beneficial for embedded systems and gain increasing attention from academia and industry.

However, the new computing paradigm and emerging memory technologies bring serious design challenges for PIM. 
-	Firstly, the analog-domain computing of PIM is sensitive to circuit noises and device non-ideal factors. Efficient and precise circuit/device models are required.
- Secondly, the large-scale PIM architectures require an unacceptably long time of circuit simulation (e.g., SPICE), making the PIM architecture and chip design inefficient.
- Thirdly, the co-design space of intelligent algorithms and PIM architectures is extremely large. How to enable efficient software-hardware co-exploration becomes a research hotspot.

In view of the above challenges, this workshop will invite the leading experts from the PIM community to share their wonderful achievements in design and optimization tools for PIM. We hope DOT-PIM can help researchers to better understand the design challenges of PIM and inspire further research directions. It will also summarize and result in a survey paper about PIM design tools (submitted to related ACM/IEEE journals, e.g., ACM TODAES, IEEE TCAD, etc.). As a complement to ESWEEK, we believe DOT-PIM will enable a strong synergy between PIM architectures and embedded systems and propose potential ideas to achieve important progress in the future.

More information will coming soon.
